# NJIT-Summer-Research
Tracking the effect of temperature on the amplitude of a filament using Image Processing and Fourier Decomposition. This research involves observing the motion of microtubules that are stabilized with Taxol. Knowing the ideal temperature to run the experiment (where the microtubule is the most stable), enables us to determine the bounds at which the microtubule is most stable for running future experiments and even chemotherapy in the future. This was done by determining the amplitude and frequency of the motion of the microtubule, we had to process the microtubule the microtubule with a filament tracking algorithm (vision tracking done with FIJI and Matlab analysis). 

# Individual Contributions
Contributed to the microtubule tracking algorithm. 
Created a Nearest Neighbor Algorithm and a MIJ Plugin for our research.
